		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Raymond, how are you doing today? <br>I was writing the phonegap version of the Android Bluetooth Chat app, for that I was writing a plugin. The question is (please bare with my usage of inappropriate words) that how do I make a request from the (java) plugin and receive it in JS? I know that we can use the _CallbackContext_ class to send back the result, but for that you have to initiate it from the JS itself, so how can I initiate it (a request) from the java plugin?<br>Hoping for a reply. Thanks in advance.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When including a phonegap plugin the documentation states that you have to reference the JavaScript code for the plugin, however I have so far found it very difficult to work out what JavaScript file to reference, the documentation doesn't seem to tell me.</p><p>In this example I am using network-information. So I tried including network-information.js and it works, however it also works when I don't include the script, I presume in this case it won't pull in the relevant adaptor and so may fail on other devices.</p><p>Any tips on how to include these plugins would be greatly appreciated.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray if I use Phonegap CLI, add plugins I see them in my main app folder. I then build for iOS and the plugins do not show up in the platform plugin folder. I can open the project in XCode and in the yellow folders my Plugins folder is empty, yet in my www folder under plugins I see them. If I try to do a remote build the project says no plugins.</p><p>I'm having a similar problem with splash and icon. Both are in my www/res folder, but never make it to my yellow Resources/icons or splash folders.</p><p>I seem to have two config.xml folders too. One in the main project and one in my www folder. www config.xml points to &lt;gap:plugin name="org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser"/&gt; and the one in the main folder has the &lt;feature name&gt; structure that points to CDVInAppBrowser.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm attempting to use Build since that seems like a more Adobe supported route but there is a lot of confusing documentation. Plugins are really strange. We add them via CLI, then add to the www/config.xml, then add the .js in index.html? What about the ones that are core. They seem to be listed as plugins but also as features?</p><p>Another thing I'm not really getting is if I want to build both locally and remotely I'm almost creating two projects within the main folder. The reason I feel the need to build locally is I have no idea what is being logged. In XCode I can at least view what is happening with say the GA plugin or PushWoosh. In Build I have no idea what is happening. I'm reading about some additional steps to get debug going for Build but why can't I just build a project and choose remote or local?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Everything you use now has to be added as a plugin. If you are ONLY using PGB, then you need to edit config.xml as I described. I believe you can skip the CLI to add them as you won't be building locally anyway.</p><p>As to your second question- I'd build locally if I were trying to debug. You can do both.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For those, you are expected to do it as per the platform's documentation. So you would need to check Android for how to do it there, iOS for how to do it there. That's my understanding and that www/config.xml was NOT meant for anything local. But it has been a while since I last spoke to an engineer about that and I could be wrong. Best bet would be to hit the PhoneGap Google group and ask, and let us know.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This blog post is about PhoneGap Build, not PhoneGap itself. I don't think PhoneGap/Android uses plugin.xml. I used the CLI to make a new PG project, added Android, added the camera plugin, and I do not see a plugin.xml. As it stands, you should just let the CLI handle it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Phonegap plugin not supported issue:  For some reason the way these plugins need to be named in the config.xml isn't congruent with the documentation.  For example: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Forg.apache.cordova.camera%3ADsR8cqbORsBbKF9uwjG_YKrfAUo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="org.apache.cordova.camera">org.apache.cordova.camera</a> will result in "plugin not supported: camera" but: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Forg.apache.cordova.core.camera%3A53aLT0woNB8pX1iTPnsqNlTdKXc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="org.apache.cordova.core.camera">org.apache.cordova.core.camera</a> will build just fine.  The way the plugin is listed on the phonegap plugins page is: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Forg.apache.cordova.camera%3ADsR8cqbORsBbKF9uwjG_YKrfAUo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="org.apache.cordova.camera">org.apache.cordova.camera</a>.  This is NOT how you want to specify it in the config.xml file.  I suspect the same is true for other plugins.  Hope this helps someone.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is it possible to use the Storage API of Phonegap (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Forg.apache.cordova.storage%3ACCDjQ5123YghTagSjbHFTyj_XFE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="org.apache.cordova.storage">org.apache.cordova.storage</a>) with phonegap build? I don't see the phonegap build plugin for it, and when I check the File plugin, it says the following "For an overview of other storage options, refer to Cordova's storage guide." but if I try to add a plugin with the cordova storage url it returns an error when building.</p><p>Is this API included in the File API of phonegap build plugin or is it not yet implemented?</p></div>
