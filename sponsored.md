My general rule is that I do not except external articles for publication on my site. I will make an exception from time to time though. I will also accept paid writing gigs where the result goes on my blog. 

My standard rate is 1K (USD) for an article between 1 to 1.5K words (including code). I will absolutely let you review text before I publish.

I no longer run banner ads on my site, but would be open to mentioning sponsorship at the bottom of my blog posts, or 
something small in the left hand sidebar. Prices are negotiable.
