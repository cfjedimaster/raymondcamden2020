## Sponsored Articles

My general rule is that I do not except external articles for publication on my site. I will make an exception from time to time though. I will also accept paid writing gigs where the result goes on my blog. 

My standard rate is 1K (USD) for an article between 1 to 1.5K words (including code). I will absolutely let you review text before I publish.

## Sponsorships

I no longer run banner ads on my site, but would be open to mentioning sponsorship at the bottom of my blog posts, or 
something small in the left hand sidebar. I can also offer a mention in the email sent out to subscribers whenever I post. Prices are negotiable.

## Traffic

Based on stats from my host, my site averages over 300K page views per month. Data from Google Analytics is much smaller (roughly 10%, so 30K), but I believe it's fairer to say my traffic is much closer to what my host reports. On average I publish one blog post per week, but you can also check my current [stats](/stats) for up to date information. 

My email subscription list is based on my RSS feed. Every time I release a new post, an email is sent out to my subscribers. As of September 2022, that list had over 80 subscribers.
