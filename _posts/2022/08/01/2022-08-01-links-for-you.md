description: Links for August 1st

It's been a little while since I've shared a links post, and while I usually save them for the weekend, I thought it would be nice to start off August with one. Also, yesterday I was busy being incredibly lazy. 

## Learn to Use Pipedream

Readers here know I'm a huge fan of [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) (you can see my posts on it [here](https://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/pipedream)). Recently they released [Pipedream University](https://pipedream.com/university), a set of free online lessons that cover how to get started building workflows. If you've been looking to give it a try, this is a great way to learn what you'll need. 

## Eleventy 2.0 Goodies

A few weeks ago Zach tweeted about some things coming to the next major version of Eleventy:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Eleventy 2.0.0-canary.13 🎈🐥🐀<br><br>🌍🆕 i18n Plugin <a href="https://t.co/Du7zYEqpmr">https://t.co/Du7zYEqpmr</a><br>📅🆕 `date: git Created` option <a href="https://t.co/gRGAxaRgFG">https://t.co/gRGAxaRgFG</a><br>⚙️🆕 URL Transforms feature: <a href="https://t.co/zw4onBq9KX">https://t.co/zw4onBq9KX</a><br><br>With excellent contributions from <a href="https://twitter.com/Snapstromegon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Snapstromegon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleMitBTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KyleMitBTV</a>!</p>&mdash; Eleventy 🎈 2.0.0-canary.14 (@eleven_ty) <a href="https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1547969969341624323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Of interest here (to me anyway) are the Internationalization updates. There's a new [plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/i18n/) to help with linking as well as new [docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/i18n/) about setting up a project properly. This is further helped with a new [URL transforms](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/#mapping-one-url-to-multiple-files-for-internationalization) feature. 

If you weren't aware, the Eleventy project is using milestones to track their work on 2.0 and you can see the complete list here: <https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/milestone/38>

## Andor Trailer

And now for something completely unrelated from tech - the new trailer for the next Star Wars show to arrive on Disney Plus, Andor:

"Rogue One" is my favorite Star Wars film so I'm really looking forward to this!
