description: Looking into easier ways to work with IndexedDB for client-side storage.
---

Many years ago, in fact, during my first stint at Adobe, I got pretty deep into client-side storage mechanisms for the web. At the time, "HTML5" was the buzzword and a lot of people were talking about improved capabilities for the web, but it seemed to me that a lot of the talk was focused on more visual components like Canvas. For me, I got more excited about things like new form fields and storage. I spent a lot of time digging into various ways of storing data, I even [wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491935111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=raymondcamd06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1491935111&linkId=239944c4f3cbf1e35ce47f4eb857b2a7) on the topic. But after spending a lot of time digging into it I moved on to other topics. 

Now - many years later - it's on my mind again, specifically IndexedDB. When I first got deep into the topic, I focused on using it as is, just the raw API, and didn't dig into helper libraries. I thought it would be a good time to look into some of the options out there and see which fit best for my development. IndexedDB isn't necessarily hard to use, but it's a bit complex and requires a bit of planning. When compared to LocalStage it's *much* more difficult, but still absolutely usable with some practice. However, it can certainly be simpler with a nice utility library. 

As I've already covered *how* to use IndexedDB here in the past I won't go into it again, but I'll use this opportunity to link to the *best* resource for learning anything web related, the mdn web docs. Their [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) docs are great and go deep into the concepts and APIs. 

For this first blog post, I'm going to demonstrate a simple application that uses IndexedDB without any helper libraries at all. It's a simple "Contacts" application (see my [earlier post](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2022/08/11/building-a-web-based-badge-scanner) for something similar) that stores a list of people, including a first name, last name, and email property. The interface lists contacts and provides a form to the right. The form on the right can be used for creating new contacts or editing existing ones.

I'll share the complete code for the application at the end, and I'm going to skip talking about DOM methods and the such. Instead, let's focus on the IndexedDB portions. 

## Initialize the Database

Any use of IndexedDB requires opening a connection to a database and handling initial object store creation. To further complicate matters, IndexedDB supports versioning and you're only allowed to make changes to a database on a version change. I handle all of this in one function:

```js
async function initDb() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        
        let request = indexedDB.open('contacts', 1);

        request.onerror = event => {
            alert('Error Event, check console');
            console.error(event);
        }
        
        request.onupgradeneeded = event => {
            console.log('idb onupgradeneeded firing');

            let db = event.target.result;

            let objectStore = db.createObjectStore('contacts', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement:true });
            objectStore.createIndex('lastname', 'lastname', { unique: false });
        };
        
        request.onsuccess = event => {
            resolve(event.target.result);
        };
    });
}
```

You'll notice I'm returning a promise so I can use it easier. I open the database, listen for an `onupgradeneeded` event, which will fire the first time the user hits the page, and set up the object store. For my contacts, I want an auto-incrementing key named `id`. Not *too* bad, but outside of this function I can just do:

```js
db = await initDb();
```

I love async/await like I love a good cookie.

Now let's look at the various CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) functions.

## Get All Contacts

Getting all my contacts so I can render them in a table isn't too difficult since there's a `getAll()` API for IndexedDB.

```js
async function getContacts() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let transaction = db.transaction(['contacts'], 'readonly');
        
        transaction.onerror = event => {
            reject(event);
        };
        
        let store = transaction.objectStore('contacts');
        store.getAll().onsuccess = event => {
            resolve(event.target.result);
        };
    
    });
}
```

Back in the calling code, I can just do: 

```js
let contacts = await getContacts();
```

The result is simple JavaScript objects in an array, so it's not difficult to use. 

## Get One Contact

Getting one contact requires a primary key. In my case, I used the `id` property so once I know that, I can use `get(key)` to fetch the record. Here's that function:

```js
async function getContact(key) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let transaction = db.transaction(['contacts'], 'readonly');
        
        transaction.onerror = event => {
            reject(event);
        };
        
        let store = transaction.objectStore('contacts');
        store.get(key).onsuccess = event => {
            resolve(event.target.result);
        };
    
    });
}
```

By the way, you'll notice that sometimes I wait for the transaction to fire a success message and sometimes I wait for a particular request to fire a success. That's a bit inconsistent but I also think it's ok too. Again though it just speaks to the complexity of working with IndexedDB. Here's an example of it being called:

```js
let contact = await getContact(key);
```

## Saving Contacts

One way IndexedDB is a bit simple however is with storing records. While there's an API to add records, there's a record to update that nicely handles creating new records when it needs to. This is done via `put` and all I need to do is either pass an object with an `id` value or not - and it just does what it needs to:

```js
async function persistContact(contact) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        
        let transaction = db.transaction(['contacts'], 'readwrite');
        transaction.oncomplete = event => {
            resolve();
        };
        
        transaction.onerror = event => {
            reject(event);
        };
        
        let store = transaction.objectStore('contacts');
        store.put(contact);
        
    });
}
```

Once again, using this is simple:

```js
await persistContact(contact);
```

## Deleting Contacts

For the last and final CRUD method we need, I set up a delete method. This requires a primary key.

```js
async function removeContact(key) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let transaction = db.transaction(['contacts'], 'readwrite');

        transaction.oncomplete = event => {
            resolve();
        };
        
        transaction.onerror = event => {
            reject(event);
        };
        
        let store = transaction.objectStore('contacts');
        store.delete(key);
        
    });
}
```

And here is the code using it:

```js
await removeContact(key);   
```

## The Whole Enchilada

All in all, once you encapsulate the complexity away into functions, it's not too difficult to use IndexedDB, and again, async/await makes life *so* much easier once you get the hang of it. But I'm really curious to see what happens after I start using a helper library or two. For the complete demo, you can use the CodePen demo below. Please forgive the slightly wonky formatting - it looks better on the CodePen site. See you in the next part!
