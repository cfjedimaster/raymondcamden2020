Happy Sunday subscribers! As always, thank you for hanging around and as always, if you've got any feedback about these
posts (or the blog in general), just send me an email at raymondcamden@gmail.com. Alright, let's get started.

## Getting Started with Live Streaming and Amazon IVS

My buddy Todd Sharp recently started a new gig at Amazon as a developer advocate for [Amazon Interactive Video Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/). IVS is the service that powers [Twitch](https://twitch.tv). IVS allows organizations to set up their own live streaming service powered by AWS and frankly, it's kind of shocking for accessible the setup is. Todd explains all of this and more in his post: ["Get Started Live Streaming in the Cloud with Amazon IVS"](https://dev.to/aws/get-started-live-streaming-in-the-cloud-with-amazon-ivs-2pdg). Give it a read and check it out. I know I was surprised. 

## Webmentions Eleventy plugin

I use [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) here as a way to show how folks are responding to my blog posts. It wasn't difficult to add to my site, but Luke Bonaccorsi has a great way to make it even easier, with an Eleventy plugin. Here he announces the plugin and links to more information: ["No Comment 2: The Webmentioning"](https://lukeb.co.uk/blog/2022/06/28/no-comment-2-the-webmentioning/)

## My interview on Breaking Changes

A few weeks back, I was honored to be interviewed on the [Breaking Changes](https://www.postman.com/events/breaking-changes/) talk show, an event run by [Kin Lane](https://twitter.com/kinlane) of Postman. It was a great conversation and I hope you enjoy it as well.
