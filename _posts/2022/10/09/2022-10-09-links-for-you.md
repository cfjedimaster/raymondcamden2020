description: A few links for your Sunday

Welcome to another Sunday post of links. I don't know about you, but I'm enjoying gathering these and sharing them, so I hope yall find value in them as well. Let's get started!

## Jasper, Static Site Generator for ColdFusion

For readers who may be new here, I was heavily involved with Adobe ColdFusion for a good twenty years or so. I don't really do much with it now, but I just got back from speaking at the [Adobe ColdFusion Summit](https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/) and it was a great opportunity to meet with a great community. My buddy Robert Zehnder has been working on a ColdFusion Static Site Generator for a few months now and it's a great project. He's been [blogging](https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/) about it and you can browse the [repository](https://github.com/robertz/jasper-cli) as well. He recently added CommandBox support which makes installation simple. Check it out!

## WebC, Web Components For Eleventy

I've been blogging about web components a lot lately and I'm pretty excited about the technology. I was thrilled to hear that Eleventy's creator Zach Leatherman has a new plugin for Eleventy, [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc). WebC lets you use web components in your Eleventy projects and render them completely server-side. He's got a good introduction article here: [Adding Components to Eleventy with WebC](https://www.zachleat.com/web/webc-in-eleventy/). I plan on digging into this very soon.

Here's a quick video introduction:

## Markdown Guide

Typically I try to have these links focus on *other* people and projects, but I also like to highlight writing I do off of this blog. A good month or so, I wrote an introduction to Markdown for Verpex: [Markdown Guide](https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/markdown-guide). I've been using Markdown for quite some time now but I'm still learning things here and there. Markdown has that great combination of power and simplicity that I love. 

That's all for today - have a great week!
