Happy Almost October! It's Fall here, and by Fall, I mean still incredibly hot and humid and reminding me why I can't wait to move out of this state (for more reasons than the weather of course). Here's a few links for you to enjoy. Have a great week!

## Playing with Data in Jupyter Notebooks with VS Code

First up is a great presentation by [Dr. Sarah Kaiser](https://twitter.com/crazy4pi314) about Jupyter Notebooks and VS Code. I've only recently discovered Jupyter Notebooks myself and find them absolutely incredible.

Next up is an excellent article by [Ollie Williams](https://twitter.com/hypeddev). As you can tell by the title, it's a look at recent changes to forms on the web.

## Monitor Events and Function Calls via Console

A short tip for something probably incredibly useful to those of using developer tools (and if you aren't, why not?) - in this tutorial, [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/) covers how to monitor events and function invocations in your console. I've been using dev tools for what feels like forever and I didn't know about this one. Read about it here: [Monitor Events and Function Calls via Console](https://davidwalsh.name/monitorevents)
