description: Adobe's new AI generative tool, Firefly
---

I'm currently at [Adobe Summit](https://business.adobe.com/summit/adobe-summit.html) and this morning at the keynote we announced the beta of [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/). Firefly is a generative AI service, which by itself isn't new, but Firefly has a strong commitment to being a more *responsible* AI service. You can read more about that and Adobe Sensei [here](https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai.html) if you would like. As an Adobe employee, I'm obviously biased, but the focus on having a responsible service that respects creators feels like a pretty important differentiator. While there are a lot of good uses for this, I decided to have some fun with it and see how well it would do something business-critical... with cats.

For my test, I looked up a list of Dungeons and Dragons classes and found this [excellent list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes) here. I then went to Firefly and used prompts like so:

<blockquote>
dungeons and dragons &lt;class&gt; as a cat
</blockquote>

In general, this worked well, but sometimes I added a bit to get things a bit closer to what I had expected. The "physical" classes looked pretty similar and I probably could have given a bit more context to help Firefly out, but I still found the results delightful.

Here's a Fighter:

Here's a Paladin:

</p>

The Barbarian, which is very similar, and could have been improved if I asked for a common weapon like an axe:

</p>

Now for something really fun - the Bard. The double-sided lute was crazy and I absolutely loved it:

</p>

Next up is the Cleric:

</p>

For Druid, I specifically asked to add a "leafy staff", and the result wasn't what I expected, but I loved it:

</p>

Here's the Ranger - I added "bow and arrow" and the result was much more stylish than I expected:

Next is the Monk:

</p>

The Rogue ended up being my favorite, it looks like they're carrying the severed head of someone they just assasinated:

</p>

Finally, while there are multiple magic-using classes in D&D, I went with simple and just used "wizard" as a prompt. The eyes on this one are crazy good:

This was fun, and if you want to try it yourself, head over to the [site](https://firefly.adobe.com/) and request Beta access. I'm not sure how long it will take to get in, but if you are interested, sign up as soon as possible.
