description: More Sunday links!
---

Good morning readers! I'm writing this in a hotel room in Tuscaloosa where my wife and I are visiting our son. He was presented with a significant award a few nights ago (the [Algernon Sydney Sullivan](https://sullivanfdn.org/) award) and we stayed up a few extra days. We're about to head back to Louisiana so I thought I'd share a few quick links with folks. Have a great Sunday.

## Taking Eleventy into the Spiderverse with eleventy-fetch

Here's a great [post](https://box464.com/posts/eleventy-fetch-marvel/) post by Jeff Sikes where he describes how he made use of the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) in an Eleventy site. That's mixing two of my favorite things, Marvel and Eleventy! I really wish Marvel would continue working on their API. The last update was nearly a decade ago, but on the other hand, I'm happy they just didn't shut it down. 

## Eleventy Collection Schemas

Yet another awesome Eleventy tip from [Stephanie Eckles](https://thinkdobecreate.com/), this [post](https://11ty.rocks/posts/eleventy-collection-schemas/) documents an Eleventy plugin for enforcing your frontmatter setup in Eleventy collections. This is *really* a good idea since Eleventy gives you complete freedom over your frontmatter, being able to enforce certain rules in your site will help prevent issues in your site. Heck, I made a mistake with my frontmatter a few weeks ago and this would have really helped!

## Frontend Development Projects with Vue 3 - Second Edition

About a year or so ago I was involved in the writing of a Vue 2 book for Packt, and now that book has been updated for Vue 3 by myself and Maya Shavin. I have to say - I've been kinda... not again... but not terribly excited about Vue lately. That being said, having used Vue 3 (obviously) for working on this book, I'm feeling somewhat better about it. I still don't think Vue is going to be my framework of choice going forward, I really prefer Alpine, but for any "application", I'd definitely build it in Vue 3. 

You can get the book from Packt here, <https://www.packtpub.com/product/frontend-development-projects-with-vuejs-3-second-edition/9781803234991>, or if you buy from Amazon [here](https://amzn.to/3Jch1Uz) I'll get an Amazon Associates kickback. Either way, check it out and let me know what you think.
