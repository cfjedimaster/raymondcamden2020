description: An update regarding my Eleventy blog guide.
---

Last January, I [announced](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2022/01/19/a-guide-to-building-a-blog-in-eleventy) the release of a guide I had written for building a simple blog in [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). Now that Eleventy has hit 2.0, I took some time this morning to look at the guide and see what could be updated. The first thing I noticed was that I had a heck of a lot of typos. I fixed those. I then went through the two main versions of the blog (before and after UI was added) and updated the dependencies to the 2.0 release of Eleventy. 

That being said, I didn't do anything else. This is not to say that the [2.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/) wasn't lacking in new features, but as my guide is meant to be as simple as possible, I wasn't on the lookout to add any new features if it didn't make sense for the blog. Of course, one of the big features of 2.0 is a big reduction in dependencies, so right away people will benefit from it. 

Anyway, you can find the guide here: <https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide.html>.
