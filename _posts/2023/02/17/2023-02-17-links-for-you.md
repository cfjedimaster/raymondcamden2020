Normally I write these "Links For You" posts on the weekend, but my family and I will be on vacation for the next few days and the laptop is *not* invited. With that in mind, here's what I'd like to share with yall, enjoy!

## Eleventy 2.0

I'm **super** excited that Eleventy has hit 2.0! You can read about all the changes on the [blog post](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/), and there's quite a bit, but for me the biggest updates are:

* Dramatic reduction (nearly a third) in dependencies.
* Faster builds (especially important on my large site)
* Async friendly shortcodes and filters

There's a lot more, so again, check the [post](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/) for details. I'm running 2.0 here, and in the new version of my site that I'm working on now.

## Hiding DOM Elements

I love working with the web and even more so, I love being surprised by what's possible. Here's a great example of that:

{% stoot "mastodon.social", "109829543415116527" %}

In this toot, Å ime Vidas is sharing a new value available to the `hidden` attribute... which I didn't even know existed! It's basically the HTML version of hiding an element via CSS. And of course, MDN has docs for it: [HTMLElement.hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/hidden)

## Configuring an Alias for Mastodon

In this [post](https://reverentgeek.com/configure-eleventy-to-host-a-custom-mastodon-alias/) by the awesome [David Neal](https://reverentgeek.com/), he describes how to create an alias for your Mastodon account with Eleventy and Netlify. I used this myself to create the alias `@raymondcamden@raymondcamden.com` for my "real" account `@raymondcamden@mastodon.social`. It took all of five minutes and honestly it's a really cool trick!

As an aside, David does [commissioned](https://reverentgeek.com/shop/) artwork. Here's one he did for me:
